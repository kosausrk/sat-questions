Similarly, the total number of messages\nsent by Tyrone is the 4 hours he spent texting multiplied by his rate of texting: p texts/hour × 4 hours = 4p texts.

The number of phones that she has left to fix at the end of each day can be estimated with the equation P d = 108 − 23 , where P is the number of phones left and d is the number of days she has worked that week. What is the meaning of the value 108 in this equation?",

When d = 0, Kathy has worked 0 days that week.\nIn other words, 108 is the number of phones left before Kathy has started\nwork for the week. Therefore, the meaning of the value 108 in the equation\nis that Kathy starts each week with 108 phones to fix because she has worked\n0 days and has 108 phones left to fix.",

Therefore, the model estimates that the boy’s height increases\nby 3 inches each year.\nAlternatively: The height, h, is a linear function of the age, a, of the boy. The\ncoefficient 3 can be interpreted as the rate of change of the function; in this \n28\ncase, the rate of change can be described as a change of 3 inches in height for\nevery additional year in age",
